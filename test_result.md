# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

COMPREHENSIVE TESTING RESULTS: ✅ Authentication: Real JWT-based login working (SuperAdmin: superadmin@demo.com/super123). ✅ API Integration: All CRUD operations functional with proper authorization headers. ✅ Data Display: Table shows all 7 required fields (Brand ID as Badge, Name, Short Name as Badge, SAP Division Code as code format, Article Type, Merchandise Code as code format, Description truncated). ✅ Create Brand: Form validation working for all 6 input fields, successful creation with API calls (POST /api/brands). ✅ Read Brands: GET /api/brands returns proper data structure, loading states working. ✅ Update Brand: Edit dialog functional, PUT requests working (though edit buttons had minor selector issues). ✅ Search Functionality: Real-time filtering across all brand fields working correctly. ✅ Error Handling: Proper error messages for validation and API failures. ✅ Responsive Design: UI works on desktop, mobile viewports. ✅ Role-Based Access: SuperAdmin permissions enforced (403 for non-SuperAdmin users). ✅ Toast Notifications: Success/error messages displaying correctly.

    message: "⚠️ BRANDS MANAGEMENT API INTEGRATION ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Successfully navigated to System Management → Brands tab. BrandsManagement component is implemented with all required features (header, description, action buttons, search, form validation, error handling, loading states, responsive design). However, the component is stuck in loading state because brandsApi.js is using example URL 'https://your-api.com/api/brands' instead of the actual backend API. Backend logs show /api/brands endpoints are working correctly (200 OK responses). CRITICAL FIX NEEDED: Update BASE_URL in /app/frontend/src/services/brandsApi.js from 'https://your-api.com/api' to use REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL environment variable. All other functionality is properly implemented and ready."

    message: "🎯 SCROLLING ISSUE FIXED: Successfully resolved Planning screen scrollability problem. ISSUE: Planning screen content was not scrollable despite having more content than viewport height. ROOT CAUSE: AppLayout component had conflicting CSS flex properties - parent div with 'overflow-hidden' and improper flex structure preventing proper scroll behavior. SOLUTION: 1) Changed main content container to use 'flex flex-col' layout structure. 2) Added 'flex-shrink-0' to header to prevent it from being compressed. 3) Maintained 'overflow-y-auto' on main content area for proper scrolling. 4) Ensured proper flex hierarchy for full-height layout. TESTING RESULTS: ✅ Scroll functionality confirmed with scrollTop: 200px test successful. ✅ Total scrollable content: 268px available for navigation. ✅ Persistent sidebar and header maintained during scroll. ✅ Smooth scrolling behavior verified. ✅ Responsive layout working across different viewport heights (800px, 600px tested).
