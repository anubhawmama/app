The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive admin dashboard with several key features, progressively enhancing it based on user requests. Initial work focused on a basic frontend MVP including login, profile, and a data grid, with a strong emphasis on mock data. Subsequent iterations added a Planning module with inline editing, history tracking, and an Analytics dashboard with various charts. A major development involved implementing a multi-departmental, role-based access control system (SuperAdmin, Admin, Creator, Approver, User) for managing system metadata (departments, brands, categories) and user permissions. Dependency conflicts with  and , and later  and , were encountered and resolved by downgrading dependencies and fixing import paths. The latest user request introduced product/SKU management and a formal Plan Management workflow, which is currently being integrated. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills in resolving frontend rendering issues and dependency conflicts.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a React-based admin dashboard application from scratch, focusing on a robust frontend MVP. The initial features include user login/logout, profile management, notifications, dynamic forms, popups, and an editable data grid. Subsequent requests expanded this into a multi-departmental planning system.

Key requirements evolved to include:
1.  **Planning Module**: A left-hand menu item Planning with a monthly grid for users to input and edit numerical data (e.g., monthly numbers). This requires API integration and a confirmation popup for saving changes.
2.  **Planning Enhancements**: History tracking for changes, filters (yearly, monthly, quarterly, entity), role-based data disabling, a notification icon with a dashboard showing trending, bar, and donut graphs, and change timelines.
3.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implementation of SuperAdmin, Admin, Creator, and Approver roles with specific permissions for viewing/editing data across departments. Departments, Brands, Categories, and Subcategories were introduced as system metadata. Creators submit monthly plans with actual/planned numbers, Approvers approve them, Admins view all data and send monthly intimations for plan submissions, and SuperAdmins have full control over system metadata and users.
4.  **User Management**: SuperAdmin and Admin roles should be able to view and add users, assign roles, and assign departments.
5.  **Product/SKU Management & Formal Plan Management**: Introduce product details (name, EAN code, category, subcategory, MRP, brand) and allow SuperAdmins to define viewing permissions for system metadata. Admins define plans (name, start/complete date, status) which generate requests for department creators to input SKU-level numbers. Data should be viewable by brand, category, subcategory, and department levels for Admin/SuperAdmin.

<pending_tasks>
-   Add the missing export for  to the  file for backward compatibility (as indicated in the last message of the trajectory).
-   Implement backend API endpoints and MongoDB models for all newly introduced frontend features (Planning, Analytics, User Management, System Metadata Management, Plan Management, Product/SKU Management).
-   Replace mock data with actual backend API calls across all frontend components.
-   Integrate proper user authentication and authorization logic with the backend.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating the new product/SKU management and formal plan management system. Specifically, the frontend was updated to reflect these new features, and the  file was significantly refactored to support the complex data structures required.

The last identified issue was an  error in the  component (Chat Message 340). This occurred because the  file was updated, and  was renamed to .

The AI engineer successfully addressed this by modifying  (Chat Message 342) to:
-   Change the import statement: 
-   Update  usages to  within the  component.

The immediate next step the AI engineer planned was to add the missing  export back to  for backward compatibility.
