The AI engineer successfully transitioned an MVP to a feature-rich admin dashboard. Initial efforts focused on FastAPI backend with JWT RBAC, frontend error handling, and a detailed Reports section. A significant milestone was the Brands Management API integration and Google Sign-In. Recent work involved implementing a Financial Planning System based on a Django schema, which initially suffered from UI layout issues (hidden navigation). The engineer created a unified  component to ensure consistent header and sidebar across all screens (Financial Planning, Dashboard, Reports, Analytics, SystemManagement, PlanningRequests, Planning, PlanManagement). Bug fixes included resolving empty  values in Financial Planning and  errors in Planning Requests by modifying mock data. New Permission and Notifications / Profile screens were implemented. The navigation was refactored to support submenus, with System Management and Permission having child items that auto-expand on click. The immediate work involves finalizing the restructuring of the Permission screen into distinct submenu components. A persistent environment configuration challenge (CORS, local vs. production backend URL) remains unresolved but was escalated to the user/troubleshoot agent.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a React admin dashboard for multi-departmental planning, featuring login, profile, notifications, dynamic forms, and an editable data grid. Core requirements include a Planning Module with monthly grids, history, filters, and RBAC (SuperAdmin, Admin, Creator, Approver). User and Product/SKU Management were added, along with a formal Plan Management workflow. Recent additions encompassed a Reports Section (filters, PDF/Excel export), application-wide loading states, and Google Sign-In. The latest major request details an Enhanced Financial Planning System based on a Django schema, requiring a hierarchical input matrix (up to 4 levels), distinct percentage/value data types, monthly/yearly planning with quarterly aggregation, actual finance inputs, unique plan codes, and a persistent UI layout with changelog and filters (department, brand, plan, month, year). This expanded to include a new Permission screen (Department, User, Role level permissions with checkboxes), Notifications and Profile screens, and a flexible submenu navigation structure for System Management and Permission.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was restructuring the navigation for the Permission section. Initially, Permission was integrated as a main menu item with internal tabs for Department, User, and Role levels. The user then requested Permission to be a main menu item with these levels as its submenus, and for the parent menu to auto-expand when a child submenu is active.

The engineer:
1.  Updated  to define Permission as a main menu item with its own  structure.
2.  Started creating separate component files for each permission level:
    *   
    *   
    *   

The creation of  was the last action taken, indicating the work is still in progress to fully implement these separate components and their integration into the 's submenu structure and routing.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Create the  component to complete the new permission level components.
