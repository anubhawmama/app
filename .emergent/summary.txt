The AI engineer successfully guided the application from an initial MVP to a feature-rich admin dashboard. Key achievements include building a comprehensive FastAPI backend with JWT-based RBAC, implementing robust frontend error handling and navigation (ErrorBoundary, 404 page), and developing a detailed Reports section with mock data, charts, and export functionalities. A significant milestone was the integration of a real API for Brands Management, involving both frontend components and backend model updates. Recently, Google Sign-In was fully integrated. The current work focuses on a new Financial Planning System based on a Django schema, using mock data, which introduced a UI layout issue where the navigation header/sidebar is hidden. The immediate next task is to rectify this layout, and add filters and a changelog to the new planning screen.

The user requested a React-based admin dashboard with core features: login, profile, notifications, dynamic forms, and an editable data grid. This evolved into a multi-departmental planning system. Key features include a **Planning Module** with monthly grids, history, filters, and role-based data control. A **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system (SuperAdmin, Admin, Creator, Approver) was crucial, managing system metadata (Departments, Brands, Categories, Subcategories) and user permissions. **User Management** (SuperAdmin/Admin) and **Product/SKU Management** (details, viewing permissions) were added, along with a formal **Plan Management** workflow to input SKU-level numbers. New features include a **Reports Section** with various filters (brand, category, department, time) and PDF/Excel export, **Application-wide Loading States**, and **Google Sign-In**. The latest request details an **Enhanced Financial Planning System** based on a specific Django schema, requiring a hierarchical input matrix (up to 4 levels), distinct percentage/value data types, monthly/yearly planning (with quarterly aggregation), actual number inputs by the Finance department, unique plan codes, and a persistent UI layout with changelog and filters (department, brand, plan, month, year) on the planning screen.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing a new **Financial Planning System** based on a detailed Django backend model schema provided by the user. This involved:
1.  **Creation of a new mock data file ()**: This file was populated with sample data structured according to the hierarchical input matrix (up to 4 levels, including GMV, Discount, Spend Break Ups, GST, etc.) and data types (percentage/value) outlined in the user's Django schema.
2.  **Development of a new React component ()**: This component was designed to render the complex planning data in a hierarchical, expandable grid, aiming to match a user-provided screenshot. It supports department-based planning, year, metrics, brands, and monthly/quarterly values.
3.  **Route and Navigation Integration**: A new route for  was added to , and navigation was updated to include this new planning interface.

The current state is that the Financial Planning screen loads, and its structure partially matches the desired output. However, a critical issue has been identified: the new Financial Planning component is currently hiding the persistent left menu and header, causing an inconsistent user experience. The user explicitly requested to fix this layout issue, and also to add filters and a changelog to this new planning screen.
